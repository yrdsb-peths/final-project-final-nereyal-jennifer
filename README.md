**The Magical Dish**
This role playing game takes you on an adventure through an enchanted forest! 

**Storyline**
Uh oh! Looks like your grandma isn't feeling well. She tells you that there are specific ingredients you must get for her to feel better!
Go through the game to collect these magical ingredients and don't be surprised if they fly!
Jump over and attack obstacles in this addicting game that re imagines classic RPGs!

**To Set up**
Clone this project and start playing! You should begin on the title screen with your character and grandma.

**Notes for Teacher**
Hi Mr. Chan! This game involves multiple worlds that act as "levels." The grandma in the story should tell you the rest. The overall gameflow includes a title screen (grandma explains game and how to play), 
a first game world involves the character jumping over rocks and attacking flying eagles all to collect flying mushrooms, the next involve collecting another ingredient while moving left and right as they fall from the sky,
and once you've collected the right amount of both ingredients, grandma will congratulate you! If you fail by touching a poisonous rock or any moving object that isn't an ingredient, it is game over!
